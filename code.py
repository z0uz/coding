    """Classical Cryptography:
Ancient Methods:
- Caesar Cipher: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- Other substitution ciphers: Various historical methods of encrypting messages by substituting letters or symbols.

Modern Classical Cryptography:
- Symmetric Cryptography: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Examples include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
- Asymmetric Cryptography: Uses a pair of keys (public and private). Examples include RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

Evolution Towards Quantum Cryptography:
Limitations of Classical Cryptography:
- Vulnerabilities to computational power increases, e.g., brute force attacks.
- Potential exposure to future quantum computing capabilities.

Emergence of Quantum Computing:
- Quantum computers can solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers, posing a threat to traditional cryptographic methods.

Introduction to Quantum Cryptography:
- Uses principles of quantum mechanics to secure information.
- Promises theoretically unbreakable encryption.

    """Quantum States and Superposition:
Quantum States: The state of a quantum system, represented by a vector in a complex vector space (Hilbert space).
Superposition: A principle where a quantum system can be in multiple states simultaneously. For example, a qubit can be in a state |0>, |1>, or any superposition of these states.

Quantum Entanglement:
Definition: A phenomenon where particles become interconnected, such that the state of one particle instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of distance.
Significance: Entanglement is fundamental to many quantum cryptographic protocols, including QKD.

Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:
Concept: It is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle.
Implications: This principle ensures that measuring one property of a quantum system disturbs other properties, providing a basis for security in quantum cryptography.
